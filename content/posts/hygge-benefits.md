## Effective remote work

Being Hygge company, Incas don't track the vacation days and time-off. Incas compensation remains the same even when they are off work for a while, as they don’t get paid for their presence, but for the accomplished tasks. 

To make sure that all the employees have adequate work environment, Inca Digital covers co-working expenses for their team-members. There is also an early childcare refund for nursery, kindergarten, or preschool for up to 6-year-old kids. A useful thing for working parents, indeed!

## Healthcare 

Health insurance, any sports compensation, mental health counseling - is there anything else you can dream of to stay healthy and wealthy? If yes, you can always contact Inca Hygge team and suggest a new benefit. They'll make their best to make it happen.

## Team meetups

Social gatherings are very important for distributed teams like Inca Digital. To meet every-human-need in socializing, they organize workations for the whole team and smaller events called Inca Meetups all over the planet.

Watch Incas workation video from Greece in September'21 and you'd definitely want to join them next time!
