![Remote Work](/img/lifestyle/remote-office.jpg)

Don’t expect to transfer the norms of co-located corporations into a work-from-anywhere scenario. When working in a fully-remote company, people are free from commuting and colleagues’ questionable music choices. You can work from wherever you want, whenever you want. However, remote work requires self-discipline. Everyone needs to document their work, and fully commit to writing knowledge down.

Experiment with different work environments. The more focused you are in your surroundings, the quicker you can accomplish your tasks and move on to important nonwork activities. Feel free to spend a month working on the beach sipping a Mai Thai, or whatever else makes you happy and productive.
