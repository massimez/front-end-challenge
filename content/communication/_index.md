**If it's not in GitHub, it never happened** Hygge Companies preserve all substantive conversations and discussions in the issue tracker, so they have the entire history of their projects in one place. All arrangements made outside the issue tracker (calls, messengers, email, etc.) are to be duplicated in issues or wikis. It is also essential to reply promptly to all requests on GitHub. Generally, Hygge Culture frowns upon work-related one-on-one conversations and reserves them for administrative, personal, and team-building matters.

**Structure** One way to show other team members that you value their time is to add more structure to your communication. Provide context, make lists, link issues, add labels, and use milestones. Without that, it will be hard for them figure out why you are doing something and whether it makes sense at all. Demonstrate that you did research and organized your thoughts before involving other people in your issues.
